Actions are text based representatsions of actions which need to be executed. 

Here is an example:
```
!!tflibrary.booksmanager.book_add 
    gitsource:'books'
    path:'technology/src'
    name:technology
```

the first part (!!tflibrary.booksmanager.book_add) is the action, the rest are the params.
